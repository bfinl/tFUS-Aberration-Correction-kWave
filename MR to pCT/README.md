# MR to pCT (Optional)

If you only collected MR data from subjects, you can use the [codes](https://github.com/sitiny/mr-to-pct) and follow the instructions offered by Yaakub *et al.* to convert them to pseudo-CT (pCT) images before trying our codes.

Please also acknowledge their work by citing the following paper if you use their MR to pCT method:
